      text: 'Summerians were among the first civilizations of humans, their society were highly complex and properly structured. They had rights for both women and men. A man was legally allowed to divorce his wife if she was barren and was seen as the head of the family by the law. The woman was allowed to testify in court and to own her properties. The summerians had courts where they settled disputes and cases. They were also the first people to pratice wearing of makeup, both men and women alike used bitumen to line their eye lids and eye shadows giving them a sinnister look, although they tought that this look was great. They also used red dyes on their lips to make them look attractive and they used some form of powder made from zinc. The summerians also invented beer and took pottery and clay work to another level. They had some interesting proverbs which they used in their speech, some includes; \'listen to the voice of your mothe as if it were the voice of God\', \'To own silver makes one happy, but a poor sleeps quietly at night\', the later was to warn against gathering too many belongings. The summerians also took perfumed baths and used nice smelling ointment on their hairs to make them more attractive, some rulers that had no beards even wore fake beards.'
